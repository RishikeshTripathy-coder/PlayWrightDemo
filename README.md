# IMP takeaways

- Microsoft Playwright is a node.js web automation tool from former members of the popular puppeeter tool team, which recently released v1. Playwright is quite similar to Puppeteer but the main diffrence is that it offers cross-browser functionality rather than only being focused on chromium only browsers.
- Playwright is a Node library to automate Chromium, Firefox, WebKit, and even Microsoft Edge with a single API. Playwright is built to enable cross-browser web automation that is ever-green, capable, reliable and fast.
- The syntax is very similar to puppeteer so it is very easy to port tests over if need be.
- By default it runs headlessly which you canâ€™t see.
- Easy to setup and it automatically handles waits with out having to hard code them.
- It has features like:
    - Scenarios that span multiple page, domains and iframes
    - Auto-wait for elements to be ready before executing actions (like click, fill)
    - Intercept network activity for stubbing and mocking network requests
    - Emulate mobile devices, geolocation, permissions
    - Support for web components via shadow-piercing selectors
    - Native input events for mouse and keyboard
    - Upload and download files
